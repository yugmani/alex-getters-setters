  <h1>Introduction to JavaScript Property Getters and Setters</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <h3>Properties and Property Getters and Setters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Property getters and setters allow you to change the default behavior
        when accessing or modifying object properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Two types of properties in JavaScript:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Properties</strong>: Used while working with objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessor Properties</strong>: These are simply the methods.
            These are executed every time working with a property to access or
            get a value and to set or change a value.
          </li>
          <li>
            The function that is executed to access some value is
            <em>getter</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The function that is executed to set or change a value is
            <em>setter</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            These methods are executed automatically, we don't need to call them
            explicitly.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Property Getters</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Property getters or methods are used to access (to get value of some
            property) properties of objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is like a regular object method where we write the
            '<em>get</em>' keyword followed by the name of getter method and
            parentheses.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is important to make sure that there is a
            <mark>return</mark> statement to return something or value in the
            body of getter method.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Property Setters</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            When you set or change value of some property JavaScript will
            execute existing property setter, or setter method, for that
            property.
          </li>
          <li>The keyword 'set' is used, to define setter method.</li>
          <li>
            In addition, we specify at least one parameter in setter method.
            Specifying is a way to pass that value to a setter so it can be
            used.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlike the getter method, the setter method doesn't have to return
            anything. Settter is used to set values and no one probably expects
            it to return anything.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Getters and setters as property wrappers</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We use getters and setters to <mark>restrict changes</mark> to
            property values. For example, we can reject change of a string value
            if new value is not a string. Or reject the change if the new string
            is empty as shown in the previous example.
          </li>
          <li>
            As shown in the previous example, one use case for getter and setter
            methods is an <em>if ... else</em> statement to dynamically check
            the new value before someone access them and/or overrides the old
            value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unfortunately, we can't create getter or setter with the same name
            as existing property. So, you may change the name of those original
            properties to may be less user-friendly and use user-friendly names
            for getter and setter methods.
          </li>
          <li>
            A well known <em>convention</em> in programming to start property
            name with an <em>underscore( _ )</em> to mark it as
            <em>internal</em> meaning
            <mark>no one should use it directly from outside the object</mark>.
            We use this convention with properties for which we want to add
            getters and setters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Therefore, first prefix all properties that will have getter and
            setter methods with underscore.
          </li>
          <li>
            Second, create property getters and setters with the same names, but
            now without the underscore prefix.
          </li>
          <li>
            This will give us properties with friendly names that we have more
            control over.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li></li>
