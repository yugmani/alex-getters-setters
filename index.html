  <h1>Introduction to JavaScript Property Getters and Setters</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <h3>Properties and Property Getters and Setters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Property getters and setters allow you to change the default behavior
        when accessing or modifying object properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Two types of properties in JavaScript:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Properties</strong>: Used while working with objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessor Properties</strong>: These are simply the methods.
            These are executed every time working with a property to access or
            get a value and to set or change a value.
          </li>
          <li>
            The function that is executed to access some value is
            <em>getter</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The function that is executed to set or change a value is
            <em>setter</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            These methods are executed automatically, we don't need to call them
            explicitly.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Property Getters</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Property getters or methods are used to access (to get value of some
            property) properties of objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is like a regular object method where we write the
            '<em>get</em>' keyword followed by the name of getter method and
            parentheses.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is important to make sure that there is a
            <mark>return</mark> statement to return something or value in the
            body of getter method.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Property Setters</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            When you set or change value of some property JavaScript will
            execute existing property setter, or setter method, for that
            property.
          </li>
          <li>The keyword 'set' is used, to define setter method.</li>
          <li>
            In addition, we specify at least one parameter in setter method.
            Specifying is a way to pass that value to a setter so it can be
            used.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlike the getter method, the setter method doesn't have to return
            anything. Settter is used to set values and no one probably expects
            it to return anything.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Getters and setters as property wrappers</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We use getters and setters to <mark>restrict changes</mark> to
            property values. For example, we can reject change of a string value
            if new value is not a string. Or reject the change if the new string
            is empty as shown in the previous example.
          </li>
          <li>
            As shown in the previous example, one use case for getter and setter
            methods is an <em>if ... else</em> statement to dynamically check
            the new value before someone access them and/or overrides the old
            value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unfortunately, we can't create getter or setter with the same name
            as existing property. So, you may change the name of those original
            properties to may be less user-friendly and use user-friendly names
            for getter and setter methods.
          </li>
          <li>
            A well known <em>convention</em> in programming to start property
            name with an <em>underscore( _ )</em> to mark it as
            <em>internal</em> meaning
            <mark>no one should use it directly from outside the object</mark>.
            We use this convention with properties for which we want to add
            getters and setters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Therefore, first prefix all properties that will have getter and
            setter methods with underscore.
          </li>
          <li>
            Second, create property getters and setters with the same names, but
            now without the underscore prefix.
          </li>
          <li>
            This will give us properties with friendly names that we have more
            control over.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Creating getters and setters on the go</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <em><mark>Object.defineProperty()</mark></em> is a way to add getter
            and setter methods to an object that already exists.
          </li>
          <li>
            This method allows you to add new properties to objects or change
            existing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using this we can add or change accessor properties, property
            getters and setters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              While using <em>defineProperty()</em> we pass in three parameters.
            </p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
              <li>
                The <em>first argument</em> is the object we want to update.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <em>second parameter</em> is the property we want to add or
                change. In the case of property getters and setters, it is the
                property for which we want to add getter and/or setter method.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <em>last parameter</em> is for object with descriptors, such
                as enumerable, configurable, value and so on. In the case of
                getters and setters, we replace the object with descriptors with
                an object containing the getter and setter method.
              </li>
              <li>
                In this case, the syntax for both, getter and setter is almost
                same as in previous examples. Only the difference is
                <code style="background-color: lightgray"
                  >missing of method names.</code
                >
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
