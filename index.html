    <h3>Properties and Property Getters and Setters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Property getters and setters allow you to change the default behavior
        when accessing or modifying object properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Two types of properties in JavaScript:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Properties</strong>: Used while working with objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessor Properties</strong>: These are simply the methods.
            These are executed every time working with a property to access or
            get a value and to set or change a value.
          </li>
          <li>
            The function that is executed to access some value is
            <em>getter</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The function that is executed to set or change a value is
            <em>setter</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            These methods are executed automatically, we don't need to call them
            explicitly.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Property Getters</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Property getters or methods are used to access (to get value of some
            property) properties of objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is like a regular object method where we write the
            '<em>get</em>' keyword followed by the name of getter method and
            parentheses.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is important to make sure that there is a
            <mark>return</mark> statement to return something or value in the
            body of getter method.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Property Setters</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            When you set or change value of some property JavaScript will
            execute existing property setter, or setter method, for that
            property.
          </li>
          <li>The keyword 'set' is used, to define setter method.</li>
          <li>
            In addition, we specify at least one parameter in setter method.
            Specifying is a way to pass that value to a setter so it can be
            used.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlike the getter method, the setter method doesn't have to return
            anything. Settter is used to set values and no one probably expects
            it to return anything.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
